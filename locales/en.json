  "intro": "Surveys often need to anonymize their data, which in many cases means, that \"personal\" information is removed. In most cases this only focusses on things like names, contact information or a personal adress. But usually it is not concerned with all the other attributes that a survey collects. But depending on the distribution of collected attributes across the observed population, those attributes could still give away an individuals identity, when for example, cross-referenced with an additional data-set. Therefore, it is important to choose those attributes wisely to ensure individuals cannot be identified through their attributes.",

This next example splits up nationalities into 125 groups and, thereby, creating groups that even go down to one individual.

  "ch4_intro": "The number of classes (bins, buckets, groups, etc.) per attribute have a strong impact on the size of groups found in a dataset. You can even use groups across your dimensions to overcome this problem. Identifying small groups and combining them with bigger groups ensures the privacy of individuals in smaller groups. <i>If you create your groups, make sure you look beyond indivdiual attributes, as this site tried to highlight.</i> To highlight the impact of such binning approaches, we end this article with showing four age pyramids, starting with a pyramid that groups by individual year and then the data for the three examples on this site with varying groups.",
